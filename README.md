# Evaluating the Impact of Cap-and-Trade Policies on U.S. Carbon Emissions: A Case Study of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)

**Author:** Khadijat Atere  
**Date:** December 2024  

## Project Overview
This project evaluates the effectiveness of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the first mandatory cap-and-trade program in the U.S. for CO₂ emissions, using a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) regression approach.

## Methodology
Using panel data (1990–2023) on power plant emission and Electric Power industry emission from the EPA, I compare emissions trends between 9 RGGI states and a control group of  Western U.S. states (excluding CA). The DiD model estimates the policy’s impact on power sector CO₂ emissions.

## Findings
- RGGI states saw a **26% drop** in CO₂ emissions post-implementation, though not statistically significant.
- A significant reduction (5.64 million metric tons CO₂e at 95% CI) was found in broader electric power industry emissions.
- Findings suggest **emissions leakage** may undermine policy effectiveness, as reductions in RGGI states may be offset by increased imports from non-RGGI regions.

## Policy Recommendations
- Expand RGGI scope to include more states and sectors.
- Tighten emissions caps and make them binding.
- Redirect revenue toward **clean energy R&D** and improved monitoring.
- Use existing low-cost infrastructure for more rigorous evaluation.
